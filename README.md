# Robot kata
The Robot kata (aka the mars rover kata):

Develop and api that moves a rover around on a grid:
- You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
- The rover receives a character array of commands.
- Implement commands that move the rover forward (M).
- Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (L,R).
- When the robot reaches the end of the grid, turn around 180 degrees.
- Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle.

The last point and the tests are not inlcuded yet.
